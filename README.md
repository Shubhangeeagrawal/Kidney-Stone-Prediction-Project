### Kidney Stone Prediction Project

### Overview

This project, part of the IBM SkillsBuild Internship Program, predicts kidney stones using machine learning. We developed an Extra Trees Classifier model to assist healthcare professionals in early detection and preventive measures.

#### Objectives

- **Model Creation:** Develop a pipeline to predict kidney stones.
- **Model Training and Evaluation:** Train and evaluate the model for accuracy.
- **Model Deployment:** Deploy the model for real-time predictions.

#### Workflow

1. **Data Preparation:**
   - Collect and preprocess datasets, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.

2. **Model Training:**
   - Create a pipeline with Scikit-learn.
   - Train the Extra Trees Classifier on training data.

3. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
   - Validate with test data.

4. **Model Deployment:**
   - Deploy using IBM Watson Machine Learning.
   - Create API endpoints for predictions.

#### Tools and Technologies

- **Python:** Main programming language.
- **Scikit-learn:** For model building and evaluation.
- **IBM AutoAI:** For automated machine learning workflow.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** For development and documentation.
- **Watson Machine Learning:** For model deployment.

#### Key Components

- **Preprocessing Scripts:** For data cleaning and preparation.
- **Training Scripts:** For training the model.
- **Evaluation Scripts:** For assessing model performance.
- **Deployment Scripts:** For deploying the model and setting up API endpoints.

#### Expected Outcomes

- **Accurate Predictions:** Reliable kidney stone prediction model.
- **Accessible Predictions:** API for real-time predictions.
- **Comprehensive Documentation:** Clear instructions and code explanations.

#### Future Enhancements
